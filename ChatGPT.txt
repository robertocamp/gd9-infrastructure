I am currently setting up an AWS EKS cluster.
I have the following demo application to test my cluster configuration:

```
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.23.4
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: 2Gi
              cpu: "1"
            limits:
              memory: 2Gi
              cpu: "1"
```

The memory and cpu resources seem a bit high in this configuration.
How can I tune those down so that my demo application is lighter and more efficient?
