it looks like the TF resource code for the monitors has a predictable pattern:

```
container_restarts {
    enabled = true
    configuration {
      observation_period_in_minutes = 6
      sample_period_in_minutes      = 4
      threshold                     = 2
    }
  }
  deployment_stuck {
    enabled = true
    configuration {
      observation_period_in_minutes = 5
      sample_period_in_minutes      = 4
    }
  }
  not_all_pods_ready {
    enabled = true
    configuration {
      observation_period_in_minutes = 6
      sample_period_in_minutes      = 4
    }
  }
  ```

  Would it be possible to somehow variablize each indvidual monitor in a more hollistic fashion?

  For example can 
  ```
  container_restarts {
    enabled = true
    configuration {
      observation_period_in_minutes = 6
      sample_period_in_minutes      = 4
      threshold                     = 2
    }
  }
  ```

  be variablized as one single variable with various components?  Just looking for some options in addition to what you've provided already.
