- *However, when using EKS, you also have the need to grant permissions to Kubernetes workloads running in the cluster*
- By utilizing IRSA, you can assign IAM roles directly to Kubernetes service accounts, allowing you to manage permissions and access control at a more granular level within your EKS cluster
- This feature enables you to leverage the existing IAM role-based access control model in AWS and extend it to the Kubernetes environment
- When you associate an IAM role with a service account, you can specify the permissions that the service account has within your cluster
- the monitoring namespace:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-07-17T00:52:01Z"
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring
    name: monitoring
  name: monitoring
```

## storage design
- Prometheus typically consumes local storage in the AWS EKS cluster to store its time-series data and other metrics
- By default, when you deploy the kube-prometheus-stack using Helm, it sets up Prometheus to use an emptyDir volume
- An emptyDir volume is a temporary storage within the pod's container, and it's created and deleted alongside the pod
- However, this means that if the Prometheus pod restarts or gets rescheduled, all the data stored in the emptyDir volume will be lost
- To ensure data persistence and avoid data loss in case of pod restarts or rescheduling, it's recommended to configure Prometheus to use Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to store its data on a more durable storage solution
- PVCs allow you to request and use storage volumes that exist beyond the lifecycle of the pod
- in order to construct the storage design we took some of Anton Putra's code (https://github.com/antonputra/tutorials/tree/main/lessons/154) and crafted the `kubernetes-addons/2-csi-driver-addon.tf` file that handles both PVC creation and IAM for storage


## IAM, service accounts and IRSA
- IAM Roles for Service Accounts is a feature provided by AWS that allows you to associate IAM roles with Kubernetes service accounts running in an EKS cluster
- Traditionally, when working with AWS resources, you would use IAM roles to grant permissions to AWS services and resources
### service account
- The service account (kube-prometheus-stack-operator) is a Kubernetes resource used to provide an identity for the kube-prometheus-stack operator running in the EKS cluster
- It allows the operator to interact with the Kubernetes API and perform actions on behalf of the service account
- In this case, the kube-prometheus-stack-operator service account is used by the kube-prometheus-stack operator itself
### clusterRole
- The cluster role (kube-prometheus-stack-operator) is a Kubernetes resource that defines a set of permissions (i.e., rules) for certain API resources within the cluster
- A cluster role is a cluster-level resource and applies across all namespaces
- The kube-prometheus-stack-operator cluster role specifies what actions the service account (kube-prometheus-stack-operator) is allowed to perform on specific Kubernetes API resources, like Deployments, Pods, ConfigMaps, etc. It essentially defines the permissions needed by the operator to manage resources within the cluster
### clusterRoleBinding
- The cluster role binding (kube-prometheus-stack-operator) is a Kubernetes resource that binds the cluster role (kube-prometheus-stack-operator) to a specific subject, in this case, the service account (kube-prometheus-stack-operator)
- It grants the permissions defined in the cluster role to the service account, enabling the service account to perform the allowed actions on the specified resources within the cluster

### IRSA
### integration
- In summary, the `kube-prometheus-stack-operator` service account is associated with the `kube-prometheus-stack-operator` cluster role through the `kube-prometheus-stack-operator` cluster role binding
- This setup allows the kube-prometheus-stack operator to act with the permissions defined in the cluster role (kube-prometheus-stack-operator) when managing and deploying resources within the cluster.
- The operator needs these permissions to create, update, and delete various resources like CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), Deployments, StatefulSets, etc., to set up and maintain the components of the kube-prometheus-stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, etc.) and ensure their proper functioning

### Prometheus Operator
- service account: `kube-prometheus-stack-operator`
- clusterRole: `kube-prometheus-stack-operator`
- clusterRoleBinding: `kube-prometheus-stack-operator`
### Prometheus
- service-account: `kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus`
- clusterRole: `kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus`
- clusterRoleBinding: `kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus`
- **IRSA:** 
  + an AWS IAM role named "prometheus" should be created
  + add the TF code to create the prometheus role into the `3-kube-prom-stack.tf` file



## kube stack deployment
### todo:  add creation of monitoring namespace to the EKS cluster creation
- `kubectl label namespace monitoring monitoring=prometheus`
I have some Terraform code that originally created the AWS EKS cluster.

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: monitoring
  labels:
    monitoring: prometheus
```
### current steps
- add blueprints tf file: 2-kube-prom-stack.tf
- add `values.yml` to the same directory where the `2-kube-prom-stack.tf` is
- Helm template: 
  + `cd infrastructure-modules/kubernetes-addons`
  + `helm template "47.1.0" prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --values values.yml > rendered.yml`
- **deploy via Terragrunt**
  + `cd infrastructure-live-v4`
  + `terragrunt run-all apply`

## node exporter
- in order for Prometheus to work with node-exporter, we must integrate IRSA configuation so that the Prometheus service account can access AWS EC2 API
## checkout
- `aws eks describe-cluster --name dev-gd9 --region us-east-2 --query 'cluster.createdAt'`
- `aws iam list-roles | jq -r '.Roles[] | select(.RoleName | test("prometheus"))'`
- `k get svc -n monitoring`
  + expected output: `prometheus-operated                ClusterIP   None             <none>        9090/TCP   64m`
- **activate prometheus UI:** `k port-forward svc/prometheus-operated 9090 -n monitoring`
  + connect to localhost:9090 in browser
  + you should get the app page
  + look for connection logs in the terminal
- check Status|Configuration

## application testing
1. `mkdir app` 
2. `cd app`
3. `go mod init github.com/robertocamp/gd9-infrastructure/app`
4. write app code
5. `go mod tidy`
6. local smoke test: `go run main.go`
7. ps aux | grep "main.go"
8. kill -9 {PID}
9. build docker image:
  + start Docker on mac
  + write Docker file
  + `docker build -t example-go-app .`
  + `docker image ls`
10. `run image locally: docker run --publish 8080:8080 myapp`
11. login to ECR: `aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 240195868935.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`
12. list your image repos: `aws ecr describe-repositories --region us-east-2`

12. create your image repo: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name myapp --region us-east-2`
13. `docker push 240195868935.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/myapp:v0.1`
14. verify image in ECR: `aws ecr describe-repositories --region us-east-2`
14. create deployment files in `app/deploy`
  + namespace has a metadata label for `monitoring: prometheus`
  + image in deployment file should match ECR (**image and image tag**): `image: 240195868935.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/myapp:v0.1`
15. deployment:
```
‚ùØ k apply -f deploy
namespace/staging created
deployment.apps/myapp created
service/myapp created
podmonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/myapp created
service/myapp-prom created
servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/myapp created
```
16. checkouts:
  + check pod: `k get pods -n staging`
  + check svc: `k get svc -n staging`
  + check pod monitor: `k get PodMonitor -n staging`
  + check svc monitor: `k get ServiceMonitor -n staging`
